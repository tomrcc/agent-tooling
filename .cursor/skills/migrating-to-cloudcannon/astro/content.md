# Content (Astro)

Guidance for reviewing and restructuring content files to be CMS-friendly in an Astro site. Run this phase after the audit and before (or alongside) configuration.

## When to skip this phase

If the audit shows content is already well-structured -- consistent frontmatter, clean markdown, no unusual extensions in content bodies -- skip content changes and just document the patterns. Not every migration needs file edits.

## Review checklist

Work through these checks for every migration. Document findings even when no changes are needed.

### Astro template artifacts in extracted content

When extracting hardcoded data from `.astro` templates into content frontmatter, check for Astro JSX expression artifacts like `{""}`, `{"</>"}`, or similar sequences that leaked from the template syntax. These are meaningless in YAML content and should be stripped to plain text. Search content files for `{"` to catch them.

### Frontmatter consistency

For each content collection, compare the files against the Zod schema in `content.config.ts`:

- **Required fields are present in every file.** If the schema defines a field as required but files omit it, either add it to the files or make the schema `z.optional()`. Prefer matching what the schema expects.
- **Optional fields with defaults.** When a field has `z.default()`, Astro fills in the default at runtime. CloudCannon editors see what's in the file, not the runtime default. If a field is commonly used and should be visible in the editor, add it explicitly to content files even if the schema doesn't require it.
- **`draft` field.** If the site filters on `draft`, ensure it's present where needed. When the filter uses `!data.draft`, omitting the field is equivalent to `draft: false` (since `!undefined === true`), so missing `draft` fields are safe. But for CloudCannon's UI, an explicit `draft: false` is better -- it gives editors a visible toggle. Collections with a `draft` field should default to the content editor (`editor: content` on add options or `_enabled_editors` starting with `content`). Draft pages aren't built, so the visual editor has no page to preview — the content editor doesn't require a built page.
- **Date formats.** Use ISO 8601 (`2022-04-04T05:00:00Z`). Astro's `z.coerce.date()` handles both Date objects and ISO strings, but CloudCannon expects consistent date formatting.
- **Image paths.** Prefer absolute paths from the site root (`/images/banner.png`) for consistency. Relative paths work but are harder to manage across collections.

### Field naming

- Use `snake_case` consistently for frontmatter keys (`meta_title`, not `metaTitle`).
- Avoid name collisions with CloudCannon reserved keys (e.g. `_inputs`, `_structures`, `_schema`).
- Keep field names descriptive and consistent across collections (e.g. always `image`, not sometimes `image` and sometimes `thumbnail`).

### Index files and the `-index` convention

Some Astro templates use a `-index.md` file to hold listing/index page metadata (title, description, image for the `/blog` listing page, for example). This pattern works by:

1. The glob loader in `content.config.ts` picks up all `.md` files including `-index.md`
2. A helper like `getSinglePage()` filters out IDs starting with `-` (so `-index` never appears as a regular item)
3. A helper like `getListPage(collection, "-index")` fetches it by exact ID for listing page metadata

**Migration action:** Rename `-index.md` to `index.md` in every collection that uses this convention and refactor the helpers accordingly:

1. **Rename the files.** Run the rename script to handle this automatically:
   ```bash
   bash .cursor/skills/migrating-to-cloudcannon/scripts/rename-dash-index.sh .
   ```
2. **Update `getSinglePage()`** to filter on `id === "index"` instead of `id.startsWith("-")`.
3. **Update `getListPage()` callers** from `"-index"` to `"index"`.

**Why `index`:** CloudCannon's `[slug]` placeholder collapses `index` to an empty string. A collection with `url: "/blog/[slug]/"` produces `/blog/` for `index.md` and `/blog/my-post/` for `my-post.md`. This means the index page gets the correct listing URL without any special-case URL config.

**CloudCannon implications:** The index file stays in the same collection as its siblings -- no separate collection or filter needed. In Phase 2 (configuration), define a separate schema on the collection for the index page so editors get the right fields when editing it vs. a regular item. See the "Schemas for index pages" section in configuration.md.

### Mixed-type fields

Some templates use fields with mixed types (e.g. `price` is a string `"Free"` for some items and an object `{monthly, annual}` for others). CloudCannon's data editor works best with consistent types. If the template only uses one branch of the type (e.g. only displays `price.monthly` from the object), simplify to a single type in the content files (e.g. always a string). Update the rendering code to match.

### Content references (string-based)

Some templates reference related content by string rather than by collection ID. For example, blog posts might use `author: "John Doe"` where the matching is done by slugifying the name and comparing to author filenames.

This works but is fragile -- renaming an author breaks the link. In Phase 2, configure CloudCannon's select input for these fields so editors pick from a list of valid values rather than typing freeform.

No content file changes are needed for this pattern.

### Markdown content body

Check for:

- **MDX components and shortcodes** -- auto-imported components or explicit `import` statements in `.mdx` files. CloudCannon's editors can't render these but can parse and re-serialize them if snippet configs are defined. Document which files use them, note each component's props, and whether `client:load` is used. This inventory feeds directly into the snippet configuration in Phase 2. See [snippets.md](snippets.md) for the full workflow.
- **Inline HTML that has no markdown equivalent** -- HTML blocks like `<figure>`, `<video>`, `<details>`, `<iframe>` can't be expressed in standard markdown syntax. These must become snippets so editors get a structured interface instead of raw HTML. For each pattern identified in the audit: (1) normalize all instances to a consistent format (same attributes, same whitespace), (2) document the normalized pattern in the project's migration notes. The snippet config itself is created in Phase 2 -- see [../snippets.md § Raw snippets for inline HTML](../snippets.md#raw-snippets-for-inline-html-in-md-files). Simple inline HTML that editors don't need to modify (e.g. `<sup>`, `<br>`) can be left as-is.
- **Complex embedded HTML** with `set:html` directives in the rendering template may not round-trip cleanly. Usually not an issue for content bodies.
- **Empty content bodies.** Index files and section data often have no body content (all data lives in frontmatter). This is normal and CloudCannon handles it fine.
- **Remark/rehype plugin output.** If custom remark or rehype plugins transform markdown in ways that affect the content structure (e.g. adding IDs to headings, wrapping images), note them but don't change the content. The plugins run at build time.

### Page-builder content migration

When converting hardcoded pages to markdown with `content_blocks`, the agent must reference the structure definition for each block type and include ALL fields — even empty ones. The structure `value` is the canonical list of fields.

**Pattern for each block:**

1. Identify the block's `_type` from the original hardcoded page
2. Look up the structure definition (either in `cloudcannon.config.yml` under `_structures.content_blocks` or in the co-located `*.cloudcannon.structure-value.yml` file)
3. Copy the full field list from the structure `value`
4. Populate fields that have content from the original page
5. Leave remaining fields at their default/empty values (strings empty, booleans `false`, arrays `[]`, objects with empty nested fields)

**Why this matters:** The visual editor throws `undefined` errors when editable regions reference fields missing from frontmatter. Getting field completeness right during the initial content migration avoids a backfill step later. See [../structures.md](../structures.md) for the full field completeness rule.

**Null values in YAML:** Bare keys with no value (`tagline:`) parse as `null`. The Zod schema must use `.nullish()` instead of `.optional()` on optional fields, otherwise `null` values fail validation and `z.union` silently falls through to a non-page-builder schema — stripping `content_blocks` from the data. See [../structures.md](../structures.md#handling-null-values-from-empty-yaml-fields) for details on aligning the Zod schema and CloudCannon config.

### Flattening folder-per-post content

When content uses a folder-per-post structure (`blog/my-post/index.md`), CC's `[slug]` placeholder resolves to an empty string (because the filename is `index`). This forces workarounds: explicit `slug` frontmatter plus `{slug}` data placeholders.

The preferred fix is to flatten to flat files (`blog/my-post.md`). Astro auto-generates slugs from the filename, and CC's `[slug]` works natively — no extra frontmatter needed.

**Checklist before flattening:**

1. **Check for sibling assets** — images or other files co-located in the post's directory. Move images to `src/assets/images/` (preserving Astro's image optimization) and other static files to `public/`. Update references accordingly — imported images use the new `src/assets/images/` path, static files use absolute paths from `public/`.
2. **Check for relative imports in MDX** — components imported with `./component.astro` paths. Move them to `src/components/` and set up `astro-auto-import` so they're available without explicit imports.
3. **Rename files** — `dir/index.md` becomes `dir.md`. Remove the now-empty directories.
4. **Remove `slug` frontmatter** — no longer needed since the filename provides the slug.
5. **Update CC config** — switch URL patterns from `{slug}` to `[slug]`.

**When NOT to flatten:**

- The folder structure encodes meaningful grouping beyond just the slug

In these cases, keep folder-per-post and use the `{slug}` workaround documented in [configuration-gotchas.md](configuration-gotchas.md#folder-per-post-content-and-cc-url-placeholders).

### Data collections

Data collections hold content that doesn't directly build its own page — it's consumed by other pages instead. They can live inside `src/content/` (as Astro content collections) or outside it (as standalone JSON/YAML files exposed via `data_config`). The deciding factor isn't location, it's purpose:

- **Builds its own page** (e.g. a blog post, a service page) — page collection, gets a URL.
- **Used on one page only** (e.g. homepage hero) — belongs in that page's frontmatter, not a separate collection.
- **Used across multiple pages** (e.g. navigation, social links, testimonials, tags) — data collection. Keeps shared data consistent and editable in one place.

Data collections should have `disable_url: true` in the CC collections config since they don't produce pages. Verify the data files themselves:

- JSON/YAML is valid and well-formatted
- Nested structures aren't so deep that CloudCannon's editor becomes unwieldy (3+ levels of nesting is a flag)
- Arrays of objects either have consistent shapes or are backed by structures definitions for each shape

## Review checklist addendum

In addition to the checks above, verify:

- [ ] Every block in `content_blocks` includes all fields from its structure definition (see [../structures.md](../structures.md))
- [ ] Empty/default values are used for fields not present in the original page (strings empty, booleans `false`, arrays `[]`)
