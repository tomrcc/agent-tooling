# Structures

Structures are templates that define the complete shape of data in CloudCannon. They serve two purposes:

1. **Array items** — when an editor adds a new item to an array (e.g. a `content_blocks` page builder), the structure populates the item with all required fields.
2. **Object inputs** — when an object input is empty, a structure tells CloudCannon what fields to offer when the editor populates it. Without a structure, CloudCannon can't know the shape of an empty object.

Without structures, CloudCannon can't populate new array items or empty objects, and existing items may have `undefined` fields that break editable regions in the visual editor.

## Field completeness rule

Every field in a structure `value` must be present in the content frontmatter, even if empty. Missing fields cause `undefined` errors in the visual editor when an editable region references them.

**This is not a backfill step.** Structures must be defined during the configuration phase and then used as the blueprint when the agent creates content files during the content phase. For each block type, the structure value is the canonical list of fields — the agent copies the full field list and populates only the ones that have content from the original page, leaving the rest as empty/default values.

### Handling null values from empty YAML fields

In YAML, a bare key with no value (`tagline:`) parses as `null`, not as an empty string or `undefined`. This creates a mismatch: Zod's `.optional()` accepts `undefined` but rejects `null`, so content files with empty fields can silently fail validation.

There are two ways to align what the content files contain with what the schema expects. Use one or both:

- **Zod schema** — use `.nullish()` instead of `.optional()` on all optional fields. `.nullish()` accepts `T | null | undefined`, so null values from empty YAML keys pass validation. This is the recommended default since it requires no per-field CloudCannon configuration.
- **CloudCannon inputs** — set `empty_type: string` (or the appropriate type) on inputs in `_inputs`. This tells CloudCannon to write `""` instead of `null` when an editor clears a field. Useful when downstream code distinguishes between `null` and empty string, or when you want the Zod schema to stay strict.

Either approach works — the goal is that both sides agree on how empty values are represented. When using `.nullish()` in Zod, component templates should continue to use truthiness checks (`{title && ...}`) since both `null` and `""` are falsy.

## Inline approach (small sites)

For sites with fewer than 5 block types, define structures directly in `cloudcannon.config.yml`:

```yaml
_structures:
  content_blocks:
    values:
      - label: Banner
        icon: flag
        value:
          _type: banner
          title:
          content:
          image:
            src:
            alt:
      - label: Rich Text
        icon: article
        value:
          _type: rich_text
          content:

_inputs:
  content_blocks:
    type: array
    options:
      structures: _structures.content_blocks
```

Link the array to the structure explicitly via `_inputs.content_blocks.options.structures` — don't rely on the naming-convention heuristic.

## Split co-located approach (5+ block types)

When a site has 5 or more block types, maintaining all structures inline in the config becomes unwieldy. Instead, each component gets its own structure file next to it:

```
src/components/
  Hero.astro
  hero.cloudcannon.structure-value.yml
  Features.astro
  features.cloudcannon.structure-value.yml
  ...
```

The input uses `values_from_glob` to collect them all:

```yaml
_inputs:
  content_blocks:
    type: array
    options:
      structures:
        values_from_glob:
          - /src/components/*.cloudcannon.structure-value.yml
```

### Naming convention

Structure-value files use the `_type` key as the filename prefix: `hero.cloudcannon.structure-value.yml` for `_type: hero`, `blog_latest_posts.cloudcannon.structure-value.yml` for `_type: blog_latest_posts`.

## `values_from_glob` vs `_structures_from_glob`

Both import structure definitions from files, but they work at different levels:

- **`values_from_glob`** — imports individual structure values into an array. Each file defines a single structure value (label, icon, value, previews). Use this for the split co-located approach where one file = one component.
- **`_structures_from_glob`** — imports named structure groups. Each file defines a complete `_structures`-like block with named keys and value arrays. Use this when grouping multiple related structures (e.g. a file defining both `header_links` and `footer_links`).

**Recommendation:** Use `values_from_glob` for per-component splits. Reserve `_structures_from_glob` for cases where one file needs to define multiple named structure groups.

## Shared sub-structures

Structures used by multiple block types — like `actions` (button arrays), `items` (feature/step lists), `stats`, `prices`, `testimonials` — stay in the main `cloudcannon.config.yml` under `_structures`. They're referenced by name from within the structure-value files and from the config.

```yaml
_structures:
  actions:
    values:
      - label: Action
        icon: ads_click
        value:
          text:
          href:
          variant: primary
          icon:
          target:
  items:
    values:
      - label: Item
        icon: list
        value:
          title:
          description:
          icon:
```

## Previews

Every structure value should include both `picker_preview` and `preview`:

- **`picker_preview`** — how the item appears in modals (the "Add" menu, structure picker). `key:` lookups are supported but often won't resolve in picker contexts (e.g. adding a new item where no data exists yet), so literal fallback values are typical.
- **`preview`** — how the item appears as a card everywhere else (sidebar array cards, collection file lists). Uses `key:` lookups to pull data from the item, with literal fallbacks.

Both accept cascading arrays for `text`, `icon`, `image`, and `subtext`. Default to arrays for each field for consistency.

```yaml
label: Hero
icon: flag
picker_preview:
  text:
    - Hero
  icon:
    - flag
preview:
  text:
    - key: title
    - Hero
  icon:
    - flag
  image:
    - key: image.src
value:
  _type: hero
  title:
  subtitle:
  # ...
```

The cascade format is an array of lookup objects — CloudCannon tries each entry in order and uses the first non-empty result. Literal strings (not objects with `key`) serve as fallbacks.

## Structure-value file anatomy

A complete `*.cloudcannon.structure-value.yml` file:

```yaml
label: Content
icon: article
picker_preview:
  text:
    - Content
  icon:
    - article
preview:
  text:
    - key: title
    - Content
  icon:
    - article
value:
  _type: content
  title:
  subtitle:
  tagline:
  content:
  items: []
  image:
    src:
    alt:
  isReversed: false
  isAfterContent: false
_inputs:
  content:
    type: html
    options:
      allow_custom_markup: true
  isReversed:
    type: switch
  isAfterContent:
    type: switch
```

### Required parts

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `label` | Display name in the Add menu |
| `icon` | Material Icons name |
| `picker_preview` | How it looks in modals (Add menu, structure picker) |
| `preview` | How it looks as a card elsewhere (sidebar, collection lists) — cascade format with `key:` lookups |
| `value` | The data template — `_type` discriminator plus all fields |
| `_inputs` | Field type configuration scoped to this component |

### The `_type` discriminator

Every structure value must include a discriminator key so CloudCannon can match array items to the correct structure definition. We use `_type` as our standard, but the name is arbitrary — `_name`, `_component`, or anything else works as long as it's consistent across all values in a given array. Similarly, `content_blocks` is our standard array name for page builder blocks, but any name works with the right config. The discriminator value must match the key used in `componentMap` and `registerAstroComponent` calls.

### Scoped `_inputs`

Field type configuration inside a structure-value file is scoped to that component. This keeps input config co-located with the component rather than polluting the main config. Only include fields that need non-default types — strings, arrays, and objects work fine without explicit configuration.

## Deriving structures from components

Read the component's Props interface (or destructuring) to determine all fields:

1. **Strings** — bare key with no value (e.g. `title:`) which YAML parses as `null`
2. **Booleans** — `false`
3. **Numbers** — `0` or a sensible default from the component (e.g. `columns: 3`). The input must be `type: number` for bare numeric values. If the input is `type: text` (or untyped), quote the value as a string instead (e.g. `price: "29"`). Bare numbers with text inputs cause a "misconfigured" error in CloudCannon.
4. **Arrays** — `[]`
5. **Objects** — nested shape with empty fields (e.g. `image:\n  src:\n  alt:`). This gives CloudCannon the field structure for the object input.

### Guarding empty objects in components

In YAML, `image:\n  src:\n  alt:` creates `{ src: null, alt: null }` — a truthy object. Component conditionals must check a meaningful inner field, not just the outer object:

- `image?.src &&` instead of `image &&`
- `callToAction?.text &&` instead of `callToAction &&`

This ensures empty objects (where all inner fields are null) are treated as absent. Check and update these guards during the visual-editing phase when wiring up editable regions.

### Fields to include

Include all props that are meaningful for editors:
- Content fields: `title`, `subtitle`, `tagline`, `content`, `description`
- Media fields: `image`, `images`
- Behaviour fields: `isReversed`, `isAfterContent`, `isBeforeContent`
- Array fields: `items`, `actions`, `stats`, `prices`, `testimonials`
- Configuration fields: `columns`, `count`

### Fields to exclude

Omit internal component props that don't belong in the CMS:
- `id` — used for HTML anchors, not content
- `isDark` — theme variant, typically hardcoded
- `classes` — CSS customization, not for editors
- `bg` — background slot content, not frontmatter
- `defaultIcon` — component-level default, not per-instance

## Default values from components

When a component defines default values in its destructuring (e.g. `columns = 3`, `isReversed = false`), use those same defaults in the structure value. This ensures new blocks added via CloudCannon match the component's expected defaults.
