# Snippets — Overview

Snippets let editors insert and edit complex markup (components, shortcodes, embeds) inside CloudCannon's rich text Content Editor. CloudCannon doesn't execute the component — it just needs to understand the syntax well enough to parse, display, and re-serialize it.

**Two distinct layers:**

- **SSG layer**: The component implementation, how it's imported/registered, build directives (`client:load` in Astro, etc.). This is what makes the component work at build time.
- **CloudCannon layer**: The `_snippets` config that teaches the Content Editor the component's syntax — its name, attributes, whether it wraps content, and what editor inputs to show. This is purely for the editing experience.

Agents must handle both layers during a migration, but keep them conceptually separate. SSG-specific snippet guidance lives in each SSG's `snippets.md` (e.g. `astro/snippets.md`).

## Configuration hierarchy

Root-level config keys that relate to snippets:

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `_snippets` | Define individual snippet configurations (the main key agents write) |
| `_snippets_templates` | Define custom reusable snippet templates (when built-in ones don't cover your syntax) |
| `_snippets_definitions` | Define reusable values shared across snippets via `{ ref: "key" }` syntax |

Most migrations only need `_snippets`.

> **Note:** `_snippets_imports` exists but should not be used during migrations. It auto-imports pre-built snippet instances for an SSG which can match content incorrectly (e.g. fenced code blocks, CSS/JS blocks). Custom `_snippets` entries give full control and work without any imports — built-in templates like `mdx_component` resolve automatically. Users can add `_snippets_imports` later if they want the pre-built defaults.

---

## Which approach?

- **Template-based** → component syntax matches a built-in template exactly (no extra directives, standard attribute format). See [template-based.md](snippets/template-based.md).
- **Raw** → extra syntax needs to appear literally, or non-standard attribute format, or fine-grained parsing control needed. See [raw.md](snippets/raw.md).

Most migrations use template-based for simple components and raw for anything with SSG-specific directives.

## Snippet properties

Every entry under `_snippets` supports these keys (shared by both approaches):

| Key | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `template` | string | Template to inherit (mutually exclusive with `snippet`) |
| `snippet` | string | Raw matching pattern with `[[placeholder]]` markers (mutually exclusive with `template`) |
| `definitions` | object | Values for template variables (used with `template`) |
| `params` | object | Parser configs for each placeholder (used with `snippet`) |
| `inline` | boolean | Can this appear mid-sentence? Default `false` (block-level) |
| `preview` | object | Card appearance in the editor |
| `picker_preview` | object | Appearance in the snippet picker modal — same options as `preview`. `key:` lookups are supported but often won't resolve in picker contexts, so literal values are typical. |
| `view` | string | Rendering mode: `card` (default), `inline`, `gallery` |
| `_inputs` | object | Input configurations scoped to this snippet's fields |
| `_structures` | object | Structure definitions for array/object fields in this snippet |
| `_select_data` | object | Fixed dropdown options scoped to this snippet |
| `strict_whitespace` | boolean | Match whitespace exactly? Default `false` (normalized) |
| `alternate_formats` | array | Other syntaxes that should also match this snippet |

## Enabling snippets in the toolbar

By default, CloudCannon shows the snippet toolbar action if snippets are configured. If you've customized `_editables`, include `snippet: true`:

```yaml
_editables:
  content:
    blockquote: true
    bold: true
    snippet: true
```

---

## When NOT to use a snippet

If a rich text field contains structured HTML with a fixed layout and only a few changing values (e.g. a banner with specific classes for centering and link styling), don't define it as a snippet. Instead, decompose the HTML into explicit props and let the component own the markup. See [astro/visual-editing.md > Structured props over rich text](astro/visual-editing.md#structured-props-over-rich-text) for the full pattern.

## Raw snippets for inline HTML in `.md` files

Snippets aren't just for MDX components. Plain `.md` content files often contain HTML blocks that have no markdown equivalent -- `<figure>` with `<figcaption>`, `<video>`, `<details>`/`<summary>`, `<iframe>`, etc. Without a snippet config, editors see raw HTML in the content editor. With a snippet, they get a structured panel with named fields.

No MDX integration or auto-import setup is needed. Raw snippets match the HTML pattern directly in the source text.

### When to create an HTML snippet

During the audit, scan content files for HTML blocks and ask: can this be expressed in standard markdown? If not, it's a snippet candidate. Simple inline elements like `<sup>`, `<br>`, `<mark>` are fine as raw HTML -- they're small and editors rarely need to modify them. Block-level HTML with multiple attributes or nested elements should become snippets.

### Workflow

1. **Inventory** (audit phase) -- grep content directories for HTML tags. Document each pattern, its attributes, and which values vary between instances.
2. **Normalize** (content phase) -- standardize all instances of each pattern to a consistent format. Remove class attributes that belong in CSS, collapse unnecessary whitespace, ensure all instances use the same attribute order. This is essential -- the snippet pattern must match every instance.
3. **Configure** (configuration phase) -- write raw snippet configs. Identify which parts are fixed structure (literal text in the `snippet` string) vs editable values (`[[placeholder]]` markers with parsers).

### Pattern design

Separate **editor concerns** from **developer concerns**. Attributes like `src`, `alt`, caption text, and `href` are editor concerns -- expose them as snippet fields. Presentation attributes like `autoplay`, `muted`, `class`, `loop` are developer concerns -- hardcode them in the literal portion of the snippet pattern.

When a pattern has multiple variants (e.g. video with controls vs video with loop), create separate snippets rather than trying to make attributes optional. Each snippet has a fixed structure with only content values as placeholders.

### Example: `<figure>` with image and caption

Source pattern in markdown:

```html
<figure>
<img src="https://example.com/photo.jpg" alt="Description" />
<figcaption>
Photo by <a href="https://example.com">Author</a>
</figcaption>
</figure>
```

Snippet config:

```yaml
_snippets:
  figure:
    snippet: |-
      <figure>
      <img [[img_attrs]] />
      <figcaption>
      [[caption]]
      </figcaption>
      </figure>
    inline: false
    view: gallery
    preview:
      gallery:
        image:
          - key: src
        fit: contain
      text:
        - key: alt
        - Figure
      icon: image
    picker_preview:
      gallery:
        icon:
          - image
      text:
        - Figure
    params:
      img_attrs:
        parser: key_values
        options:
          models:
            - editor_key: src
              type: string
            - editor_key: alt
              type: string
          format:
            root_value_delimiter: "="
            string_boundary:
              - '"'
      caption:
        parser: content
        options:
          editor_key: caption
    _inputs:
      src:
        type: image
      alt:
        type: text
      caption:
        type: html
```

The `key_values` parser handles the `<img>` tag's `src` and `alt` attributes as a group. Use `key_values` (not `argument`) for HTML attribute values — see [gotchas](snippets/gotchas.md) for why. The `content` parser handles rich text (including nested HTML like `<a>` tags) in the figcaption. The `view: gallery` + `preview.gallery.image` shows the actual image in the content editor — see [snippet preview for images](#snippet-preview-for-images) below.

### Example: `<video>` with fixed attributes

```yaml
_snippets:
  video_controls:
    snippet: |-
      <video autoplay muted="muted" controls plays-inline="true">
      <source [[source_attrs]] type="video/mp4">
      </video>
    inline: false
    preview:
      text: Video
      icon: videocam
    params:
      source_attrs:
        parser: key_values
        options:
          models:
            - editor_key: src
              type: string
          format:
            root_value_delimiter: "="
            string_boundary:
              - '"'
    _inputs:
      src:
        type: url
```

All presentation attributes are literal. Only the video URL is editable. Even with a single variable attribute, use `key_values` — the `argument` parser does not work for values inside HTML attribute quotes. Fixed attributes like `type="video/mp4"` stay in the literal text after the `[[placeholder]]`.

## Snippet preview for images

Any snippet that contains an image (figure, hero, card, etc.) should use `view: gallery` so editors see the actual image in the content editor instead of a generic icon card.

Three keys work together:

- `view: gallery` — switches the snippet from a compact card to a large image preview
- `preview.gallery.image` — cascading option pointing at the image field's `editor_key`
- `preview.gallery.fit` — `cover` (default, crops to fill) or `contain` (shows full image)

Use `picker_preview` to override the gallery for the snippet picker modal (where you choose which snippet to insert). The picker doesn't have image data yet, so disable the gallery image and show a static icon instead.

```yaml
view: gallery
preview:
  gallery:
    image:
      - key: src
    fit: contain
  text:
    - key: alt
    - Fallback label
  icon: image
picker_preview:
  gallery:
    icon:
      - image
  text:
    - Snippet Name
```

Apply this pattern to every snippet that has an image `editor_key` — not just `<figure>`. If the snippet has an image field, give it a gallery preview.
